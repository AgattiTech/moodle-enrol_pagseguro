Plugin de inscrição via PagSeguro para o Moodle
-----------------------------------------------

The PagSeguro enrolment plugin allows you to set up paid courses.

The plugin has to be enabled by the site administrator and then added to the course by an administrator or manager.

You can then set an individual price for your course if needed.

This is an updated version based on https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=enrol_pagseguro
